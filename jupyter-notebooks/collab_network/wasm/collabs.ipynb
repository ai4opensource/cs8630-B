    "\n",
    "This notebook is not answering to a particular hypothesis- we are developing this technology as background for future work. However, the above results are good candidates for inspection because they summarize an intuitively sensible finding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The network being considered is a raw collaboration network between people across four communities. The histogram following highlights the populations of contributors conditioned on their historical contribution breadth- WHO has contributed WHERE, naively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that, for the majority of contributors, only one project receives attention. There are noticable linchpin contributors in the network that connect WASMTime+WASMEdge, or WASMTime, WASMer, and WAVM, but most contributors participate in only one project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further study might answer the question of inter-project collaboration quality: for those people who participate in more than one project, are they doing so in the same way? Are those who are influential in one community more likely to be influential in another?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key take-away:\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the projects studied, there are minor overlaps on contributorship with some noteable linchpins, but even considering collaboration back to 2017, the projects are relatively siloed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suggested questions for future work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Are the repos studied connected semantically by purpose? If they're in the WASM domain but aren't actually used together in practice (some being Browser WASM while others are serverside) then they'd obviously be fairly disconnected. Could be fertile ground for a project discovery phase- where are the contributors to the known projects also contributing? What does that 2nd round collaboration network reveal about collaboration densities between projects?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How high-quality are the edges that connect two projects by the proxy of contributor collaboration? If the correspondence is mostly in issue threads, for instance, these lower-impact edges insinuate communication, but don't directly imply technical collaboration or idea sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.1. If we track this network over time, we could identify a new project that has a high existing-contributor migration signal. This new project, which is inheriting interest from existing contributors, could be very interesting in its ecosystem. We could identify this project by considering anomylous edge creation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How strong are project walls? e.g. to what extent do contributors, when clustered empirically, map to a single project versus a cluster that represents multiple projects? If an unsupervised 'n' clustering on the network of 'n' projects yields weak overlap, or significantly better clustering for 'n-m' clusters, this suggests that the collaboration space is in a higher-level embedding (to abuse the term) than repo-level."
